h2. About

*friendly-git* is a collection of shell scripts for automating basic git flows I find myself typing over and over again.

Frankly I think a lot of these should be git defaults, like rebasing and automatic remote tracking. But I digress...

h2. Install

Checkout this repository somewhere:

  git clone git://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly.git ~/dev/git-friendly

Add the directory to your PATH:

  export PATH=~/dev/git-friendly:$PATH

You'll want to put that somewhere cool like ~/.bash_profile so it's executed each time you launch a terminal.

I'd also recommend making some basic pimpings to your ~/.gitrc to add chill features like ANSI color, command shortcuts, rebase by default & more. My .gitrc is "here":https://gist.github.com/668161

h2. Commands

I literally use them in this order

* *pull* -- stashes any local changes, pulls from remote using rebase, pops your stash, and re-bundles if necessary
* *branch [newbranch]* -- creates a new branch both locally & remotely, with remote tracking enabled (so you can just type 'git pull' and not 'git pull origin newbranch')
* _[programming genius goes here... I just use vanilla 'git commit', 'git status', 'git diff']_
* *merge* -- merges your amazing new branch back into master using rebase. Always Be Rebasing.
* *push* -- pushes your mindblowing changes to the remote and copies a sexy URL like "http://github.com/jamiew/myrepo/compare/3f9fea...fv932" to your clipboard that you can easily share with your peers. This only works on Macs, but boy is it sweet.

Misc commands:

* *prune* -- cleans up old remote branches & runs garbage collection
